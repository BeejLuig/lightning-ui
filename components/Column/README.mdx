# FocusManager

In Lightning, focus must be explicitly set on an element and managed manually. `FocusManager` is a utility component that simplifies focus for elements in a list.

## Usage

Within a parent component `_template()` function, define a child of type `FocusManager` and in `_getFocused()` return that child component 

```js
import FocusManager from './FocusManager';

class RowExample extends lng.Component {
  static _template() {
    return {
      Row: {
        type: FocusManager,
        children: [
          // components to be managed
        ]
      }
    };
  }
  
  _getFocused() {
      return this.tag('Row');
  }
};
```

By default, `FocusManager` handles left and right key events. You can also explicitly set the `direction` property to `row` for left/right or `column` for up/down.

```js
{
  type: FocusManager,
  direction: 'column',
  children: [/* ... */]
}
```
